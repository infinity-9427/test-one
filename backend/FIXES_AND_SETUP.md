# Website Design Scorer - Fixed Issues & Setup Guide

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Google Sheets Service Initialization**
**Problem**: Google Sheets service was not properly initializing on startup, causing background logging to fail.

**Solution**: 
- Added automatic initialization in the background task
- Improved error handling and health checks
- Fixed initialization sequence in the application startup

### 2. **Image Storage in Spreadsheets** 
**Problem**: Using `=IMAGE()` formulas in Google Sheets was unreliable and caused display issues.

**Solution**:
- Changed to store direct Cloudinary URLs instead of formulas
- URLs are clickable and more reliable
- Added separate columns for image URLs and thumbnails

### 3. **Docker Integration & Service Coordination**
**Problem**: Services weren't properly coordinated during container startup.

**Solution**:
- Created `startup.py` script for proper service initialization
- Added health checks for all services before starting
- Updated Docker configuration for better reliability

### 4. **Error Handling & Logging**
**Problem**: Some error conditions weren't properly handled, causing silent failures.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling in all service modules
- Added comprehensive logging with analysis IDs
- Created test suite for validation

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
cd backend/

# Start all services (Ollama + Backend)
./start.sh

# Check service status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend/

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run startup checks
python startup.py

# Start the application
./start_backend.sh
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
cd backend/
python test_setup.py
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture (Playwright)
- ‚úÖ Cloudinary upload
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets logging
- ‚úÖ Full workflow integration

## üìä Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5vl:latest

# Cloudinary (Image Storage)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Google Sheets (Results Logging)
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_PATH=credentials/google-sheets-service-account.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
```

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Sheets API
3. Create a Service Account
4. Download credentials JSON file to `credentials/`
5. Share your spreadsheet with the service account email

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### 1. **Screenshot Capture**
- Uses Playwright to capture desktop (1200x800) and mobile (375x667) screenshots
- Automatically uploads to Cloudinary for storage
- Returns both full-size and thumbnail URLs

### 2. **Cloudinary Integration**
- Optimizes images (WebP format, auto quality)
- Generates thumbnails automatically
- Provides CDN URLs for fast delivery

### 3. **Google Sheets Logging**
- Logs analysis results in the background
- Includes direct image URLs (not formulas)
- Stores scores, metadata, and AI insights

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation (continues if one service fails)
- Detailed logging with unique analysis IDs
- Health checks for all services

## üì° API Usage

### Complete Analysis (One Endpoint)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/master/analyze-complete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "store_cloudinary": true,
    "auto_log_to_sheets": true,
    "include_mobile": true,
    "include_ai_analysis": true
  }'
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "master_1754223456",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "status": "completed",
  "screenshots": [
    {
      "device": "desktop",
      "cloudinary_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      "captured_at": "2025-08-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "uploads": {
    "desktop_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "desktop_thumbnail": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "mobile_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "mobile_thumbnail": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  },
  "overall_score": 85.5,
  "scores_breakdown": {...},
  "ai_insights": {...}
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Google Sheets service not initialized"**
   - Check credentials file exists: `credentials/google-sheets-service-account.json`
   - Verify spreadsheet ID in `.env`
   - Ensure service account has access to the spreadsheet

2. **"Cloudinary not configured"**
   - Verify all three Cloudinary variables in `.env`
   - Check credentials are valid with test connection

3. **"Screenshot capture failed"**
   - Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `playwright install chromium`
   - Check if URL is accessible
   - Verify Chrome/Chromium is available in Docker

### Check Service Health
```bash
# Overall health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Master orchestrator health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/master/health
```

## üìà Performance Notes

- **Screenshots**: Optimized for consistent dimensions (viewport-only capture)
- **Uploads**: WebP format with auto-quality reduces file sizes by ~50%
- **Caching**: Screenshots cached for 24 hours to reduce duplicate work
- **Background Processing**: Google Sheets logging happens asynchronously

## üîÆ Next Steps

Your setup is now working correctly! You can:

1. **Frontend Integration**: Use the single endpoint `/api/v1/master/analyze-complete`
2. **Customize Scoring**: Modify weights in `weights.yaml`
3. **Add AI Models**: Configure different Ollama models in `.env`
4. **Scale**: Add load balancing and multiple workers

---

All issues have been resolved and the system is now fully functional! üéâ
